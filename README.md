Drupal-Top-100-Downloader
=========================

The script downloads the current top 100 drupal modules from http://drupal.org/project/usage
It requires drush: http://drupal.org/project/drush
And the BeautifulSoup Library: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/

Check out the Downloads for an OS X app that downloads all of the modules within the application package contents.

After you double-click the application, use finder to "Show Package Contents".
Within this folder you will find a folder called drupal. This is where the downloaded modules are.
